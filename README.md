# Rigid-Body-Movement-and-Perspective-Projection

This is a college work of the Computer Vision subject, where you can

- Visualize the three-dimensional position and orientation of a camera and an object.

- Changing the position and orientation of the camera (extrinsic parameters) through three-dimensional translations and rotations. ATTENTION: The object does not need to be moved, only the camera.

- Translations and rotations can be done both in relation to the world's reference frame and in relation to the camera's own reference frame.

- View the image of the object generated by the camera.

- Change intrinsic camera parameters (focal length, scale factor of each axis, key point)

- Every time something is changed, the 3D view and the image generated by the camera must be updated.
